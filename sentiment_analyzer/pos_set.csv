"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . ",positive
"for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . ",positive
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . ,positive
"the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . ",positive
"in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . ",positive
"if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . ",positive
"getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? ",positive
"the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . ",positive
"it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . ",positive
"when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . ",positive
"abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . ",positive
"upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . ",positive
"i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . ",positive
"in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . ",positive
"it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . ",positive
"and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) . ",positive
don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . ,positive
"now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . ",positive
"the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . ",positive
oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . ,positive
"even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . ",positive
"ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . ",positive
"i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . ",positive
"the film , however , is all good . ",positive
"2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content ",positive
"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling .",positive
"mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example .",positive
did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ?,positive
the plot is deceptively simple .,positive
george washington carver high school is having student elections .,positive
"tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high .",positive
"mr . "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run .",positive
"and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons .",positive
"the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be .",positive
"you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have .",positive
"_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype .",positive
"what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier .",positive
the similarities are staggering :,positive
"tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .",positive
"max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .",positive
the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .,positive
the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .,positive
"tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive .",positive
"max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive .",positive
"the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .",positive
he even gets a bee sting .,positive
"the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .",positive
he gets several bee stings .,positive
and so on .,positive
what happened ?,positive
"how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ?",positive
"even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy .",positive
"broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then .",positive
witherspoon is a revelation .,positive
"it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination .",positive
"and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over .",positive
one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it .,positive
there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .,positive
"i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . .",positive
"but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .",positive
"as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story .",positive
"it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ?",positive
"even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does .",positive
"there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment .",positive
the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do .,positive
"lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice .",positive
"the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower .",positive
"most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants .",positive
it takes a pretty smart person to do that .,positive
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ?,positive
what if he's also able to think on his feet ?,positive
"in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ?",positive
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator .,positive
"in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force .",positive
"when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder .",positive
"faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office .",positive
"i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" ,",positive
although it wouldn't surprise me if he did .,positive
"luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .",positive
"after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t .",positive
"walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed .",positive
"although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue .",positive
"jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman .",positive
"the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats .",positive
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence .,positive
"how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ?",positive
"unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability .",positive
"almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back .",positive
"when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course .",positive
his is an interesting character .,positive
"made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation .",positive
" "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says .",positive
"when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be .",positive
"soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail .",positive
this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor .,positive
"as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely .",positive
gray really lucked out with this cast .,positive
"david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey .",positive
"the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a .",positive
"in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land .",positive
"with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven .",positive
"also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides .",positive
"his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything .",positive
"fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout .",positive
"j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances .",positive
"sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film .",positive
"walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon .",positive
"for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton .",positive
"when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) .",positive
"the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing .",positive
"in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality .",positive
we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best .,positive
"as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film .",positive
both provide some pretty good entertainment .,positive

">from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters .",positive
"1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big "" breakthrough "" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting .",positive
"as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar .",positive
"not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics .",positive
"as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it .",positive
"the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it .",positive
"however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film .",positive
"and to my surprise , it grew on me .",positive
"the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship .",positive
"see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend .",positive
"also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out .",positive
"carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done .",positive
"for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few .",positive
perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny .,positive
"and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's "" somebody to love "" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam .",positive
"the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie .",positive
"i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend .",positive
"also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing .",positive
"still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out .",positive
"or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . )",positive
"hell , that's what i do every day .",positive
the event of events is upon us .,positive
people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it .,positive
i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused .,positive
it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history .,positive
"anyone who tells you "" it's just a movie "" is either lying or clueless .",positive
it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic .,positive
the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated .,positive
but that does not mean that the film itself is bad .,positive
"in fact , it is terrific .",positive
i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash .,positive
it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place .,positive
"the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo .",positive
"the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate .",positive
"unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene .",positive
"on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) .",positive
"he is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi .",positive
"as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker .",positive
>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie .,positive
"around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul .",positive
"i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this .",positive
"this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks .",positive
"he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? """,positive
"and "" mesa go now , okeday ? "" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying .",positive
the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph .,positive
if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement .,positive
"the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term "" popcorn movie "" .",positive
what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams .,positive
"even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant .",positive
his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling .,positive
the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia .,positive
"when you see "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away "" , when the familiar music plays , when the words "" star wars "" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 .",positive
"it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side .",positive
"it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not .",positive
"we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years .",positive
"the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars .",positive
"it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia .",positive

blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men .,positive
blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it .,positive
it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well .,positive
"although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie .",positive
"the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story .",positive
"but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once .",positive
"that really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit .",positive
"blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire .",positive
his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire .,positive
including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust .,positive
blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother .,positive
"but this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films .",positive
"the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires .",positive
where do vampires get money ?,positive
"well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations .",positive
"i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie .",positive
blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community .,positive
"he isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority .",positive
he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable .,positive
it's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire .,positive
"admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through .",positive
"the story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less .",positive
the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type .,positive
"this isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this .",positive
the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise .,positive
"it's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise .",positive
blade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster .,positive
the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done .,positive
"although , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences .",positive
blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre .,positive
this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle .,positive
what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life .,positive
very cool .,positive
" "" footloose "" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .",positive
and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .,positive
"the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .",positive
he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .,positive
"as mentioned at the beginning of this review , "" footloose "" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .",positive
"there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate .",positive
so why did i enjoy it so much ?,positive
"for one thing , the cast is great .",positive
kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .,positive
"we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the "" rebel without a clue "" sort .",positive
"yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be .",positive
and he never broods .,positive
the rest of the cast is equally impressive .,positive
"john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .",positive
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .,positive
"by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .",positive
another nice touch is the music .,positive
"we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "" sexual innuendos "" , but that's not true at all .",positive
"the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .",positive
"during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .",positive
"of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .",positive
"anyway , "" footloose "" is a charming little surprise .",positive
don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .,positive
"it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you .",positive
"everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with "" progress . """,positive
"giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis .",positive
"his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth .",positive
"this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns "" erstwhile fogy "" giles into a three-dimensional human being .",positive
"despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love .",positive
"and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places .",positive
"giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go .",positive
what he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii .,positive
a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress .,positive
"just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight .",positive
"giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes .",positive
" ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . )",positive
"eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located .",positive
"bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) .",positive
"eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice .",positive
"but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant .",positive
"love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that .",positive
"in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect .",positive
"it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it .",positive
"in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target .",positive
"in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited .",positive
"from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame .",positive
"it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions .",positive
"jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie .",positive
"he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie .",positive
"meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin .",positive
"love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a "" fish out of water "" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) .",positive
"yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots .",positive
"it has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile .",positive
