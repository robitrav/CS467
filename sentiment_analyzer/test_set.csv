"even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . ",positive
"broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . ",positive
witherspoon is a revelation . ,positive
"it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . ",positive
"and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . ",positive
one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . ,positive
there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . ,positive
"i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . ",positive
"but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . ",positive
"as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . ",positive
"it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? ",positive
"even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . ",positive
"there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . ",positive
the happy bastard's quick movie review. ,negative
damn that y2k bug . ,negative
it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . ,negative
little do they know the power within . . . ,negative
"going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . ",negative
"we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . ",negative
"here , it's just "" hey , let's chase these people around with some robots "" . ",negative
"the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . ",negative
you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . ,negative
"sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course . ",negative
"the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . ",negative
"so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . ",negative
"otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . ",negative
