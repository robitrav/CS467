initial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals .,negative
production values are shoddy .,negative
most serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate .,negative
this problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen .,negative
"rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick , such as his turnaround on wellington's plans for a poor neighborhood hospital ( 'bullet in the head ?",negative
"you got a bed ! ' ) , but he's uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast .",negative
regina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis .,negative

"no . but it definitely sucks and it's basically because . . . well ,",negative
it's just not funny .,negative
"and for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it .",negative
"it starts off slow , it's got no energy , it doesn't engage you with any of its characters ( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else . . . lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting . . . waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing .",negative
"and then hank azaria shows up . . . aaaaaah , the film's savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that's another story altogether ) .",negative

"it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by .",negative
even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel .,negative
"firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement .",negative
"he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman .",negative
"as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases .",negative
i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started .,negative
"but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van .",negative
"with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road .",negative
jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars .,negative
"but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town .",negative
"the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars .",negative
"director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies ,  there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience .",negative
"but by the time these interesting changes occur , its far too late in the film for them to have much affect .",negative
hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par .,negative
"not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected .",negative
such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations .,negative
"strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta .",negative
"we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character .",negative
"if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no .",negative
"i now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) .",negative
"although hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen .",negative
"the addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else .",negative
"despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film .",negative
"no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films .",negative
there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened .,negative
"and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why .",negative
this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago .,negative
"fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky .",negative
"it's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) .",negative
it turns out that he's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit .,negative
"seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa .",negative
no . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa .,negative
it's the environmental protection agency .,negative
i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers !,negative
taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice .,negative
"written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks .",negative
but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in .,negative
seagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket .,negative
"but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people's porches for free .",negative
that's another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches .,negative
"slow and plodding , this project is a total mess .",negative
the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige .,negative
"here , his bravado basically turns into bullyness .",negative
townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued .,negative
fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever .,negative
and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes .,negative
"the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment .",negative
"but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal .",negative
kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away .,negative
"seagal gallantly replies : "" i'll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . """,negative
i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background .,negative
this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal's righteousness and narcissistic arrogance .,negative
"seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) .",negative

"as for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground .",negative
it's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ?,negative
"chabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium .",negative

"in yet another example of a "" friend "" faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod .",negative

now that would've had some pizzazz !,negative
lost in space luckily doesn't suffer in every single category that it could have .,negative
"the special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse .",negative
"unfortunately , oldman is locked away for most of the film , giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy .",negative
"while the special effects are pleasing to the eye , they are nothing you couldn't find in most modern sci-fi films .",negative
"contact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination .",negative
"lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! ) , wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you'd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens .",negative
"then again , with an ending like this film has , it's obvious a sequel is already being considered .",negative
"what an awful note to end on , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two .",negative
"the attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups .",negative

this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity .,negative
" "" desperate measures "" is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic .",negative
"it's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more "" before and after "" than "" reversal of fortune . """,negative
"the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing .",negative
"too bad the execution's all wrong , though , because the set-up of "" desperate measures "" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use .",negative
san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission .,negative
"even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society .",negative
"connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital .",negative
"when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy .",negative
"one misstep "" desperate measures "" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness .",negative
"what's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow .",negative
"take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital .",negative
"the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ?",negative
he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight .,negative
"connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son .",negative
whatever .,negative
"to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie's problems .",negative
"first and foremost is how cheaply "" desperate measures "" trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour .",negative
"once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills .",negative
there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away .,negative
"also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; "" desperate measures "" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this .",negative
"there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department .",negative
"cast against type , michael keaton's understated menace is highly effective .",negative
"although he's not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord .",negative
"joseph cross , as garicia's ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos .",negative
"this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost .",negative
"it goes without saying that "" desperate measures "" needs an operation of its very own .",negative

"the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters .",negative

i didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) .,negative
"degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair .",negative
either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist .,negative
"every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid .",negative

degeneres' sgt .,negative
rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait .,negative

"sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a "" creative yet unfocused "" ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney .",negative

"ben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his .",negative
the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again .,negative

probably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears .,negative
"at least the former "" ellen "" star is going for something a little different .",negative

i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this .,negative
here's an example of some of the film's flat-out stupidity .,negative
sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers .,negative
"she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite "" the sound of music "" on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims .",negative
so what was the point of the wig and the car ?,negative
" "" the sound of music "" stuff might be a reference to "" the wizard of oz "" allusions in david lynch's "" wild at heart , "" but if so joff ? must have forgotten that "" wild at heart "" was a despicable movie .",negative
"it's hard to believe that "" goodbye , lover "" was directed by the same person who made "" the killing fields "" and "" the mission . """,negative

"capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence .",negative

"pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire .",negative

"humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms .",negative
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .,negative

"when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish .",negative
the final irony of the original version has become film history .,negative
"without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series .",negative
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .,negative
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .,negative
"that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking .",negative
"serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .",negative
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .,negative
"but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .",negative
"few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .",negative
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best .,negative
"when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s .",negative
"while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .",negative
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .,negative
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .,negative
"for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful .",negative
"first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .",negative
"he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .",negative
"that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .",negative
"as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .",negative
"in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .",negative
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .,negative
" ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )",negative
"he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .",negative
and the language they talk is earth- english .,negative
apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .,negative
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .,negative
both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .,negative
in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships .,negative
outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .,negative
"leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .",negative
ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .,negative
she is bent on making the world a better place .,negative
perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari .,negative
"in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .",negative
she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .,negative
it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .,negative
this is a further abandonment of the source material .,negative
"the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book .",negative
we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .,negative
we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .,negative
burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .,negative
"this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .",negative
they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .,negative
"the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like "" i never met an ape i didn't like , "" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .",negative
most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .,negative
the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .,negative
this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .,negative
in general it seems much improved from 1968 .,negative
"the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .",negative
in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .,negative
it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .,negative
"chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .",negative
today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement .,negative
these visuals work nicely .,negative
what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .,negative
"they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .",negative
apes spring incredible distances .,negative
"some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost .",negative
one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .,negative
since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .,negative
the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .,negative
"it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .",negative
but he delivers them very well .,negative
"he was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .",negative
"as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well .",negative
in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .,negative
he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus .,negative
as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .,negative
"danny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .",negative
that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .,negative
i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .,negative
